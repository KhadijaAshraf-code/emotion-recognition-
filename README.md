#  Emotion Recognition Project
##  Overview
This project focuses on **Emotion Recognition**, where a machine learning / deep learning model is trained to classify human emotions such as *happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral*, etc.  
It can be applied in **sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and AI assistants**.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (text cleaning or image augmentation).
- Deep learning-based classification.
- Multiple emotion categories supported.
- Visualization of training accuracy and loss.
- Functions for making predictions on new samples.

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
download dataset from this Kaggle FER – 2013
##  Notes
- Restarted training to verify model – notebook reran all epochs.This caused all epochs to start over again.
